# Book_Recommendation_System

This system combines popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized book recommendations tailored to your interests. The popularity-based recommendations ensure that you discover trending and widely-loved books, while collaborative filtering enhances the suggestions based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.


## **How It Works**

The system uses a combination of algorithms to enhance your reading experience:

**Popularity-Based Recommendations:** Discover books loved by the community at large, ensuring you don't miss out on widely acclaimed titles.

**Collaborative Filtering:** Leverage the preferences of users with similar tastes to receive personalized suggestions that go beyond popularity.


## **Web Interface**

The web interface is designed for a seamless experience:

**Homepage:** Displays the top 50 books recommended by the system, offering a quick overview of popular choices.

**Recommendation Input:** On the next page, use the input text box to enter the name of a book. Receive instant recommendations based on collaborative filtering.
